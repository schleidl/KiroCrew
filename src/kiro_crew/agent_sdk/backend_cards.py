"""What each harness can do, projected from the memberships it already declared.

The Developer > Agent Backend switch asks one question this module answers: what
does an operator lose or gain by picking this harness rather than that one? Every
answer here is a PROJECTION over :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends` -- the
capability sets, :data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.ACP_BACKEND_ROUTING`, and
each harness's auth declaration in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.host_auth`. Nothing
here is authored per harness, and there is no ``if backend ==`` anywhere in the
file: a harness that joins a set gains its line, and a harness this build has
never heard of renders a complete card the moment its id is in
``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN``.

Two levels, not four
--------------------
A card line is AVAILABLE or NOT AVAILABLE, and that is the honest ceiling. A
``frozenset`` carries one bit -- in, or out -- so three states a graded card would
want to tell apart are indistinguishable in the source data: cannot do it, does it
differently, and nobody has measured it. ``ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_DISPATCH`` is the
case that proves it: codex is a non-member because, in the set's own words, "what
is missing is a DECISION, not a mechanism", while opencode is a non-member on the
same words and KAS is a member on a captured mount. A projection cannot tell a
deliberate no from an unmeasured one, so a graded level would have to be authored
per harness per capability -- the per-harness prose this projection exists to
remove.

The ONE fact that is genuinely graded already carries its own grade:
:class:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends.Routing` names five mechanisms and one
"not established", each with a documented meaning and a fail-closed default. It is
rendered as data (:attr:`BackendCard.tool_approval`) rather than folded into a
boolean.

Which memberships reach a card, and how
--------------------------------------
Four buckets, and every ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` set in the vocabulary module reaches at
least one of them (``test_backend_cards`` fails when a new set reaches none, so
adding a set forces the decision rather than defaulting it):

* **user-facing** -- switching harness changes what the user can DO: a control
  appears or disappears, a command is refused, tools are absent from a session, a
  chat cannot be continued. These are :data:`USER_FACING_LINES`, and each is a
  capability whose ABSENCE is a loss, because that is what an available /
  not-available mark means to a reader.
* **security** -- it changes which layer confines the agent, whether Crew hands
  its own credential to the child, or how an unclassifiable approval is answered.
  These are :data:`SECURITY_LINES`. They are stated only when they HOLD and are
  rendered OUTSIDE any disclosure, next to the tool-approval line: "Crew's sandbox
  is not confining this child" is at least as material as how the harness is made
  to ask, and a fact behind a closed disclosure is a fact an operator comparing
  harnesses does not see.
* **operator** -- it says where something LIVES: whose disk holds the transcript,
  which side supplies the model list, which channel carries a command. These are
  :data:`OPERATOR_LINES`, also stated only when they hold, because a caveat is
  either raised or absent -- "this harness does not relocate its home on a pod" is
  not information anyone reads.
* **off-card** -- the only difference the membership makes is which code path
  runs, with the same observable product behaviour when both paths are correct.
  The test for this bucket: if the membership were wrong, would the user see a
  missing feature, or a bug? A wrong ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING`` costs a user
  ``spawn_continue``. A wrong ``ACP_BACKENDS_SEED_LOCAL_SETTINGS`` is a stale
  model, i.e. a defect. Defects are not capabilities, so they stay off the card --
  see :data:`OFF_CARD_SETS`, which carries the reason per set.

``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`` is in none of the four: it is the membership floor, and a
card existing at all already says it.

A membership whose two states are BOTH fine is a note, never a line. Three sets
are that kind, and each would otherwise put a red cross beside a harness that
loses nothing:

* which side owns the transcript -- Crew holds the kiro family's under its own
  sessions tree, so a reopened chat comes back either way;
* where the model list comes from -- Crew serves the kiro family's ids from its own
  registry;
* which channel carries a slash command -- ``ACP_BACKENDS_KIRO_SLASH_COMMANDS``
  names the ``_kiro.dev/commands/execute`` RPC, and a non-member is not
  command-less: opencode and pi both publish their own built-ins as an
  ``available_commands_update``. Read as "your slash commands stop working" it
  would be false for exactly those two, so the card states the CHANNEL as a note
  and claims nothing about a harness that carries its own.

A set may also inform a line it does not decide alone. Two lines are unions,
because no single set answers the question a user asks; a set that is a union
INPUT is not thereby classified, and no set decides more than one line on its own.

Why the sets are named as STRINGS here
--------------------------------------
Each line names its inputs by set NAME and resolves them through
:func:`_membership`. Two reasons, and the second is a live hazard rather than a
preference:

* it is what lets the completeness test compare what the vocabulary DEFINES
  against what this file classifies. Comparing the frozensets themselves cannot
  do it -- seven of them are equal to ``frozenset({""})`` today, so equality
  proves nothing about which name was meant.
* a value bound at import time does not follow a test that injects a synthetic
  harness by patching the DEFINING module (``test_member_memory_auth`` does
  exactly that). The patch would land on an attribute nothing reads, and the card
  would answer from production membership while the test believed otherwise.

The MCP half, which is a projection over another source
-------------------------------------------------------
One question an operator asks is not answerable from a membership set: what
happens to their AGENT SPEC on the way to this harness. That is declared per
backend in ``providers/mirrors`` -- the projection KIND, the reach of a per-tool
MCP restriction, and a disposition per spec concern -- and
:mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_mcp_ability` projects it. :func:`card_payload`
carries it as its own key so the panel and ``kirocrew doctor`` read one card, while
each projection stays a projection over ONE source.

Why this is not ``SessionCapabilities``, and not in ``backends.py``
------------------------------------------------------------------
:class:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.capabilities.SessionCapabilities` answers what one
LIVE session's harness can do, for consumers that must not branch on a harness id.
This module answers what an operator is choosing BETWEEN, before any session
exists, and it is read by exactly one consumer on a request path
(``dashboard/handlers/acp_backend_status``). Keeping them apart is why neither
grows the other's fields.

It cannot live in ``backends.py`` either: the ``vocabulary-home`` ratchet
(``scripts/check_harness_parity.py``, H8) reserves the ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` spelling
for that module, so a projection over those sets is a function in a module of its
own -- the same shape, and for the same reason, as
``host_auth.backends_retired_by_host_logout()``.
