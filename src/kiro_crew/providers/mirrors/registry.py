"""Which backend projects the agent spec how — as a typed declaration, per backend.

The point of a registry rather than a lookup that returns ``None`` on a miss is
that **absence has to be a statement**. A backend with no entry here fails the
parity test; a backend that genuinely needs no projection says so, in a record a
test can read.

A free-text reason was not enough to carry that distinction. "Declared not to
need one" and "nobody got round to it" were both spelled as a paragraph of prose
under one name, so a selectable backend could sit there with an explanation of
why its projection had not been written and every check stayed green. That is the
structural reason the same missing-tools defect shipped on four harnesses in a
row. :class:`McpProjection` replaces the paragraph with a KIND, and the kinds
that are not finished states carry the fields that make them addressable — what
would have to exist, and where the work is tracked.

The declaration lives here rather than in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`,
which owns the capability sets, for one mechanical reason: that module is a leaf
that imports neither ``kiro_crew.acp`` nor ``kiro_crew.providers``, and
``config.loader`` reaches it from inside ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``. A table
naming this folder's mirror classes would put that cycle back. The projection
vocabulary (:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Concern`,
:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Disposition`) already lives in this
folder, so the declaration that selects between them belongs beside it.

    to a backend is a property of the transport, and the three members below are the
    three states that exist -- each one observable in what the projection returns,
    which is what lets a test hold the declaration to the behaviour rather than to
    its own prose.

    This is a DECLARATION, not a requirement. Per-tool MCP deny is not something
    every provider can offer, and this folder's thesis is that an honest "this
    transport cannot carry it" beats a projection that quietly drops it. What a
    reader needs is to know WHICH of the three they are getting before a session
    runs.

    Three members rather than the one flag its shipped reader branches on
    (``cli_doctor`` acts on ``WHOLE_SERVER`` alone), and the reason is the drift
    test rather than a future renderer: the three states are told apart by two
    INDEPENDENT observations -- whether a narrowed server stays mounted, and whether
    the projection hands the client a deny set -- so the test catches claude
    silently ceasing to write its deny rules and codex silently ceasing to hand over
    its pairs. A boolean cannot express either: both would read false and stay
    false while the behaviour changed underneath. A reader that renders all three
    (the per-provider ability card) is a consumer this serves, not the reason it has
    three members.
