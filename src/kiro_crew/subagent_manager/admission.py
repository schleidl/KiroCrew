    """Return a denial reason if *executor* may not run remotely, else ``None``.

    ``EXECUTOR_LOCAL`` is answered ``None`` without consulting governance: an
    ordinary local spawn is not this gate's subject and must cost nothing.

    Fail-closed in three separate directions, because each one is a way a remote
    spawn could otherwise happen unasked:

    1. **An unknown executor kind is refused**, not passed through. Membership is
       positive (``REMOTE_EXECUTORS``), so a kind added later is refused until it is
       listed and reasoned about, rather than admitted by not matching anything.
    2. **The capability must be AFFIRMATIVELY granted.** The evaluator's omission
       contract makes an unnamed capability ungoverned-and-permitted, which is
       correct there and would be wrong here -- on a host with no policy at all,
       "nobody denied it" would be enough to ship the operator's repository and
       tool calls to a remote account. So ``remote_exec_enabled`` must say yes AND
       ``governance_permits`` must not deny (that second half is what lets a
       per-surface PROFILE take a policy grant back, tightest-wins).
    3. **A governance evaluation error denies.** ``PlatformCompositionError``
       propagates as the CPP contract requires; anything else is audited as a
       degrade and denied.

    The caller must REFUSE the spawn on a non-``None`` return. It must never fall
    back to a local spawn: the request was "run this somewhere else", and answering
    it by running untrusted work on the operator's own machine is not a narrower
    outcome, it is a different and worse one.

        Approval priority (first match wins):

        1. YOLO mode → immediate execution
        2. ``approval_mode="auto"`` from caller → immediate execution
        3. parent session trust (``approval_policy == "auto"``, the dashboard
           Trust toggle) → auto-approved execution
        4. ``auto_approve_subagent_spawn`` config → auto-approved execution
        5. ``on_spawn_approval`` callback → interactive approval, unless the
           callback reports it has no surface to raise the prompt on, in which
           case the spawn is refused immediately (see
           ``_spawn_with_approval_impl``)
        6. Otherwise → rejected

        When ``approval_mode="auto"`` is set, it has two effects:
        - Skips the spawn approval gate (this method)
        - Sets the subagent's session-level tool approval policy to
          "auto" in ``_run_inner()``, meaning all tool calls within
          the subagent are auto-approved for its entire lifetime.

        This dual behavior is intentional for headless callers (e.g.
        Mochi bg agent) that have no UI to respond to approval prompts.
        The parameter is only accepted via the internal ``POST /api/spawn``
        endpoint (requires X-Internal-Secret), not from LLM tool calls.

        Args:
            task (str): The prompt/task description for the subagent.
            parent_session_key (str): Session key of the caller.
            agent (str): Agent name override (default: "kirocrew").
            model (str): Model override for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            reasoning_effort (str): Per-call reasoning-effort override; wins
                over the ``role_efforts['subagent']`` pin. ``""`` defers to it.
            allowed_tools (list): Tool allowlist for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            bare (bool): Launch CC in bare mode (ignored for ACP).
            cwd (str): Optional absolute path where the subagent subprocess
                launches instead of the default ``subagent_<id>`` sandbox.
                Validated against ``AgentConfig.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots``;
                rejected spawns return a done ``SubagentInfo`` with ``error``
                set. Enables cwd-relative resource globs (``AGENTS.md``,
                ``.kiro/steering``, ``CLAUDE.md``) to resolve correctly.
            approval_mode (str | None): "auto" to skip spawn gate and
                set session-level auto-approve.  Only honored from
                authenticated internal callers (X-Internal-Secret).
            silent (bool): Suppress completion notifications.
            executor (str): Which executor runs the member. ``EXECUTOR_LOCAL``
                (the default, and what every caller that passes nothing gets) is
                the ordinary local spawn. A remote kind must be a member of
                ``REMOTE_EXECUTORS`` AND be granted
                ``capabilities.remote_exec``; otherwise the spawn is REFUSED
                here. It is never downgraded to a local spawn -- see
                ``_vet_remote_exec_governance``. Keyword-only, so the facade's
                positional forwarding is unaffected.

        Returns:
            SubagentInfo | None: Agent metadata, or None if at capacity.
